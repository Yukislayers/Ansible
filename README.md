# Overview

We will learn how to identify what we can automate and how to break it down into distinct tasks. Then we will set up a working automation environment with Ansible.  

Then, we will learn how to write task configuration scripts with modules using YAML syntax, and push them onto our servers with playbooks.

Finally, in the third part, we'll look at an example of a custom module and how to create it.  

## Steps

1. Install an Apache web server on the first server.
2. Install PHP on the first server.
3. Install a MariaDB database on the second server.
4. Download MediaWiki source files and upload them to the apache web server
5. Configure the Apache web server to point to the URL http://http1/mediawiki
